# Main 3 components of workflow are inputs, outputs, and steps

inputs:
# All inputs go here for each step. No way to break them up.
# We should talk to the CWL people about that.

outputs:

# Check where we copy these probably at CWD
# Files need to exist at end of workflow, but we aren't currently checking
# We have function to get workflow_outputs
