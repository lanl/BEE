## CWL Feature Experiments

This directory contains small tests and examples of CWL features that will be used when constructing representative workflows. These codes are used to experiment with, and learn about, CWL features. 

- *`glob`*: In CWL, globbing is used to capture and name output of steps and workflows.
- *`scatter`*: These codes test the `ScatterFeatureRequirement` feature of CWL. This feature is used in workflows that execute a job for each file produced in one step of a workflow.
