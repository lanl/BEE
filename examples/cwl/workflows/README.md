## Synthetic CWL Workflows

This directory contains small, tractable, CWL code that mimics workflows of interest to BEE:

- *`simple`*: Simple workflows that are not necessarily representative of "real" workflows but can be used to test various BEE festures (e.g. parser, workflow manage, etc.).
- *`2step`*: Two stage workflows similar to traditional compute/visualize scientific computing workflows.
- *`3step`*: Three stage workflows representing compute/analyze/visualize.
