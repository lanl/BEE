## CWL Examples

This directory contains exampes of CWL code that can be used for testing or experimentation. There are two top-level subdirectories, `features` and `workflows`:

- *`features`*: CWL code used primarily for experimentation with various CWL features (e.g. globbing, scatter, etc.). These codes are used primarily as small, tractible, vehicles for understanding CWL.
- *`workflows`*: CWL code that represents synthetic workflows of interest to the BEE project. These codes are used to drive developent of BEE features (e.g. parser) and test the entire BEE system without running "real" workflows.
